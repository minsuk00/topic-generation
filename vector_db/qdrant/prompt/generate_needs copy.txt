# DEFINITION
Market needs refer to the functional needs, desires and goals of a target audience.
1. The **target** and **objective** must be clear. For example, "improving sleep" is a good target as it is clear ("to improve sleep"), while "a healthy aging society" is not a good example due to its broad scope.
2. The more specific the target, the better. For instance, "improving sleep" specifically targets "sleep," whereas "improving safety" (safety being the target) is less clear because "safety" is an attribute or state that does not clearly suggest an approach or solution.
3. The **objective** is a vector (direction) and can be classified into three categories:
    1. Basic: The most fundamental and essential desires necessary for life (e.g., food, water, shelter, safety).
    2. Escape: The desire to escape from a negative state or problem (e.g., recovery from illness, getting out of debt, reducing stress or anxiety).
    3. Enhance: More advanced desires pursued after basic needs are met (e.g., the desire for self-actualization, recognition or appreciation, creativity, or personal growth).
